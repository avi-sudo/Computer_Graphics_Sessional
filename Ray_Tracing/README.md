This repository contains all the programs coded for assignment on ray casting and ray tracing.

In this assignment, realistic images are generated for geometric shapes like sphere, triangle, plane, and general quadric surface using ray casting as well as ray tracing with Phong Illumination Model technique. OpenGL and OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT) have been used to visualize the provided scenario in input file.
